letters come in over serial, sit in the hardware buffer or the tusb buffer whatever
either by callback or by scheduling, convert letters into a series of events, push the events into the event buffer with some timing info

event {
  abs_time;
  ev_enum;
}

enum

how big is the tusb buffer such that we can let it fill up?

main thread is driving the event loop, which plays events from the event buffer at the correct times
